            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>BioAssayBuddy is an intelligent assistant designed to democratize bioassay development expertise. It is meant to provide personalized assay development support taking into account your comfortability with the assay. It can help you plan a new experiment or assist with ongoing experiments. You tell it the specific development problem you are facing and will address it accordingly. Currently you can interact with the AI agent through using the link below and answering the webform questions.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="problem">
            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>Bioassay development can be time-consuming and prone to trial-and-error. Researchers often face challenges in optimization, troubleshooting, and data interpretation, leading to delays and increased costs. There is a high demand for qualified assay development professionals, therefore it is difficult for small firms to hire and retain talent. Assay Development can be rather complex and the time spent training new individuals on assay development skills could be better spent on experiment execution.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="solution">
            <h2>The Solution</h2>
            <p>Our AI-powered assistant provides actionable guidance, answers technical questions, and helps design more efficient experiments. BioAssayBuddy brings consistency, speed, and confidence to your workflow. It is trained on relevant experiment procedures and troubleshooting methods. Through a dynamic prompting method, the AI agent is able to provide tailored advice on how to proceed with your development experiment. The AI agent also has tools to assist it with analyze relevant experiment data, further refining the recommendations it provides.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="how it works">
            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>The user starts by entering high level experiment information in a webform. The information is used to dynamically create a prompt that is then provided to the agent so that it can provide tailored recommendations. The recommendations are then emailed to the user at the email they provided.</p>

          <h2>Demo Pictures</h2>
          <p>Hereâ€™s the webform welcome page when user details are provided:</p>

        <section id="use cases">
            <h2>Use Cases</h2>
            <p>Currently the MVP can be used to optimize ELISA experiment parameters. The workflow takes into account different user experience levels and can be used to guide unfamilair operators through development projects. In the future, it will be able to help the user figure out where to source reagents and materials through interacting with databases.</p>

        <section id="team">
            <h2>Meet the Team</h2>
            <p>Currently the team consists of a solo developer Emmitt J Tucker. He is a graduate student at Northeastern University and has years of industry experience in the biotech sector specializing in assay development. He is passionate about the potential for Human-AI collaboration in the sciences and seeks to build products that will help make humanity more productive.</p>
